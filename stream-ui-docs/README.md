## OTA(s) to show // Position 
![](position.png)

The filter "OTA(s) to show" displays the selected OTA's position in search packets. 

10 results are displayed in every search packet, and when the user scrolls down far enough 10 more are loaded and sent as a separate packet. Every result has multiple agents, which are the different brands competing through price for the same flight. In the UI the selected OTA's highest ranked flight result and their agent's relative place is displayed. 

If "all" or "your OTAs" are selected the OTA among them with the highest result and place is displayed.

The difference between "all" and "your OTAs" is that "all" also displays the competitor OTAs' click packets (with fields hidden).
